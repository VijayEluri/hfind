Changes in 1.0.1
    * Added support for -print0 and -delete.
    * Added JVM option hfind.local. Set -Dhfind.local=true for hfind
      to crawl the local filesystem (turns hfind into find).
    * Added -v,--verbose option to print the full HDFS path (with URI and namenode).
      This option will also print deleted files when used with -delete.
    * Fix HDFS timeout bug when crawling deep trees.
